# MR-PL
MR-PL is a one-sample multivariable Mendelian Randomization method, which could take into consideration the correlation among numerous exposures (e.g., brain imaging features) followed by correcting for the winnerâ€™s curse bias.
## Prepare dependencies
Make sure you have the R package dependencies below installed and accessible in your $PATH.   

`BiocManager::install('pls')`  
`BiocManager::install('glmnet')`  
`BiocManager::install('hdi')`  
## Input files
* __g_matrix.txt__:  the genotype matrix of *n* samples and *m* snps.   
* __exposure_matrix.txt__:  the exposure matrix of *n* samples and *k* exposures.    
* __outcome_matrix.txt__:  the outcome vector of *n* samples.    
* __gwas_assoc.txt__:  the gwas summary statistics of *m* snps and *k* exposures, which is usually derived from a previously published study.  
 
Where the genotype matrix, exposure matrix and outcome are from the same dataset.  

Example data are listed in the `example/` folder.
## Usage
Detail information describes how to perform MR-PL can be found in example.R in the `example/` folder.  
   
Briefly, if the gwas summary statistics used to selected instrumental snps is based on the same dataset used for MR analyses, the following can be run
```
mr_result = mr_pl(g_matrix0, 
                  exposure_matrix0, 
                  outcome, 
                  gwas_assoc, 
                  cutoff = 5e-8, 
                  wcc = TRUE, 
                  c = 20,  #c = 15/25
                  pleiotropy_test = TRUE)
```
If the gwas summary statistics used to selected IVs is based on another independent dataset, the following can be run  
```
mr_result = mr_pl(g_matrix0, 
                  exposure_matrix0, 
                  outcome, 
                  gwas_assoc, 
                  cutoff = 5e-8, 
                  wcc = FALSE, 
                  c = 0, 
                  pleiotropy_test = TRUE)
```    
## Output
mr_result$main_results: exposures with non-zero causal estimate and its corresponding p-value from lasso projection method.
